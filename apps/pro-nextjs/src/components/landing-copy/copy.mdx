You know how to build React apps. Your Next.js app is humming along. You are productive and confident.

**You’re comfortable.**

Or are you?

Just when you thought you had it all figured out with React apps and Next.js, **the React landscape has shifted completely**.

But what if you could turn this upheaval into an opportunity? What if you could not only adapt to these changes but also leverage them to create more powerful, efficient, and robust applications?
