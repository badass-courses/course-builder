# Welcome to Course Builder

Building a course is a complex process. It requires research, design, production, and delivery to be successful. It's not
enough to rush something out and hope for the best. In fact, creating and selling a high-quality course that meets **your**
expectations of "success" while also meeting the expectations of your students is a difficult task.

It requires many iterations of [The Process](https://badass.dev/the-process) to get right.

- The Landing Page
- The Blog
- Tip Videos
- Free Tutorials
- A Podcast
- A Newsletter
- A Book
- Live Workshops
- Self-Paced Courses

All of these are iterations of The Process. They are all ways to build an audience, test your ideas, and build a business
around your expertise.

Course Builder is a **technical implementation** of a full-stack course framework. It's a way to build a course that
represents the experience we've had building courses for the last 10 years at [egghead](https://egghead.io) and
[Badass Courses](https://badass.dev).

Course Builder is a **framework** for building courses. It's not a course platform. It's not a course marketplace. It's
all of the pieces that you need to **launch your own course platform and marketplace**.
