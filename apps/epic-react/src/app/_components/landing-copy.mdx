# Epic React Builder

This site is for registered Epic React instructors (please log in, let us know so we can add roles) that want to self-publish to Epic React. This focused on `Posts` which  is stand alone, and not specifically part of a collection like a Tutorial, Workshop or a Playlist.

A Post can have many underlying types, eventually including collections such as playlists and courses, but for now we are going to stick to one offs. We are already publishing podcast episodes as videos to the site, so if you're interested in that type of content, please reach out to us.

As you create related posts, we will open up the discussion with you about how you'd like to present it in a collection to your audience.

**This site is live and when you hit `publish` the content will be available on egghead.io!**

## What to publish

We are looking for content that is useful to Epic React audience.

Epic React audience is forward-thinking, busy, working professionals.
