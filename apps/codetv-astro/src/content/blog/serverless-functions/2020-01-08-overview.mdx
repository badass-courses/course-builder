Serverless functions are an approach to writing back-end code that doesn't require writing a back-end.

In the simplest terms: we write a function using our preferred language, like JavaScript; we send that function to a serverless provider; and then we can call that function just like any API using HTTP methods.

This is _huge_ for front-end developers. **We're now able to add powerful "back-end" logic to our apps just by writing JavaScript — no devops, no server code, no fuss.**

This _also_ means that our **Jamstack apps gain all the benefits that come along with server-hosted apps, but with significantly lower setup and maintenance costs.** We can deploy in seconds using [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/?utm_source=learnwithjason&utm_medium=serverless-intro-jl&utm_campaign=devex) and use our serverless functions immediately.

Put another way: serverless functions turn front-end developers into full-stack developers _without requiring us to learn or manage the full stack_.

## Serverless function examples and tutorials

To explore what serverless functions can do, I created a bunch of small examples — I've collected them in this post, and I'll add additional posts as they’re published.

- [Deploy your first serverless function](/blog/serverless-functions/deploy-first-serverless-function/)
- [Access query string parameters in serverless functions](/blog/serverless-functions/query-strings-serverless-functions/)

**Heads up!** [Tara Z. Manicsic](https://twitter.com/tzmanics) wrote a solid, short overview of serverless. If you're not familiar with the term, check it out: _[What Is Serverless Besides a Bad Name for Using Servers](https://dev.to/tzmanics/what-is-serverless-besides-a-bad-name-for-using-servers-35ag)_.
