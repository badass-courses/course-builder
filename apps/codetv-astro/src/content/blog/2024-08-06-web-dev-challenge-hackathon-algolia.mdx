## The prompt: build an e-commerce site... with a twist

E-commerce makes the world go round, and we want you to shake up the standard e-comm approaches with something a little different. The twist can be anything: make us laugh, add some M. Night Shyamalan flair — have fun with it!

Apps must use [Algolia][sponsor] as part of the build. Algolia provides solutions for quickly adding search, recommendations, and more to web apps with pre-built components, fast responses, and painless integration.


## Make new connections and get expert guidance

We've set up a dedicated channel in the [Learn With Jason Discord](https://lwj.dev/discord) called `#builder-chat` for brainstorming, sharing ideas, and keeping each other accountable.

We'll have devs from the Algolia team available to provide technical guidance as you're building.

<Aside variant="heart">
  **A note from Jason:** don't miss out on the chance to make connections with industry pros and get hands-on feedback on your code! Opportunities like these are a chance to <a href="https://lwj.dev/manufacture-luck">manufacture your own luck</a> — don't pass it up, especially if you're looking for new opportunities!
</Aside>

Find an accountabilibuddy, get expert guidance from the Algolia team, run your idea past Jason and other community members, and listen in to what the rest of the community is cooking up in this open call to kick off the hackathon.

RSVP to add it to your calendar:

  ¹ The time limit is intended to make this a quick project that can fit most schedules. That being said, if you decide to spend more time on this, we'll never let a silly thing like rules stand in the way of a good time.
