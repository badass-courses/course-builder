If you want to use custom fonts with Cloudinary, you need to upload them as authenticated assets. This script will allow you to upload an OTF or TTF to use when adding text overlays to images.

<Aside warning>

**IMPORTANT:** only upload fonts if you have the appropriate licenses.

## Create a project and install dependencies

Make sure you've created a folder, initialized the Node project, and installed the `cloudinary` Node SDK:

```md
mkdir upload-fonts

cd upload-fonts/

npm init -y

npm install --save cloudinary
```

## Upload the custom font to Cloudinary

Create a file in this folder called `upload.js` and add the following inside:

```js
const cloudinary = require('cloudinary').v2;

// this is shown at the top right of https://cloudinary.com/console
const CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = '<YOUR CLOUD NAME>';

// find these at https://cloudinary.com/console/settings/security
const CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = '<YOUR CLOUDINARY API KEY>';
const CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = '<YOUR CLOUDINARY API SECRET>';

// path to the custom font (TTF or OTF only), relative to this file
const PATH_TO_FILE = 'my-font.ttf';

// used in Cloudinary URLs — no underscores allowed!
const PUBLIC_ID = 'my-font.ttf';

const uploadToCloudinary = async () => {
  cloudinary.config({
    cloud_name: CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
    api_key: CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
    api_secret: CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
  });

  const result = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(PATH_TO_FILE, {
    resource_type: 'raw',
    type: 'authenticated',
    public_id: PUBLIC_ID,
  });

  console.log(result);
};

uploadToCloudinary();
```

Update the information at the top with your own Cloudinary and font info, then run the script:

```bash
node upload.js
```

You will see the output of the script showing the upload details (or an error, if one occurred). It will look something like this (some details masked):

```js
{ public_id: 'Tahu!.ttf',
  version: 1578268616,
  signature: '342a1f68ea8815b2894dadf8ecc65935ca7daade',
  resource_type: 'raw',
  created_at: '2020-01-05T23:56:56Z',
  tags: [],
  bytes: 39972,
  type: 'authenticated',
  etag: '98c36c6da792d6726ffdba9e6d6989ab',
  placeholder: false,
  url:
    '<http://res.cloudinary.com/jlengstorf/raw/authenticated/[redacted]/v1578268616/Tahu%21.ttf>',
  secure_url:
    '<https://res.cloudinary.com/jlengstorf/raw/authenticated/[redacted]/v1578268616/Tahu%21.ttf>',
  access_mode: 'public',
  original_filename: 'Tahu!' }
```

**NOTE:** this example uses the [free Tahu! font](https://www.behance.net/gallery/63159677/TAHU-FREE-SCRIPT-FONT).

## Use the custom font in a Cloudinary image

Now that we've uploaded the font, we can use it for image overlays.

Let's start with this image of a llama:

![a llama](https://res.cloudinary.com/jlengstorf/image/upload/w_800,q_auto,f_auto/v1578269094/llama-kimmy-williams.jpg)

</Figure>

The URL to display this image is:

```md
https://res.cloudinary.com/jlengstorf/image/upload/w_800,q_auto,f_auto/v1578269094/llama-kimmy-williams.jpg
```

We can break this URL into four pieces:

1. **`https://res.cloudinary.com/jlengstorf/image/upload`** — this is the **URL base**, which is going to be the same for all images in my Cloudinary account
2. **`/w_800,q_auto,f_auto`** — these are **image transforms** tells Cloudinary that I want the image at 800 pixels wide and that the format and quality should be set automatically to best suit this browser
3. **`/v1578269094`** — this is teh **version**, an optional piece that allows Cloudinary to cache the image aggressively to cut down on bandwidth and processing
4. **`/llama-kimmy-williams.jpg`** — this is the **public ID** of the image we want to display and an optional extension telling Cloudinary what format should be used (this will be overridden by `f_auto`, though)

To insert our custom text overlay, we'll add a new piece in between the image transforms and the version, which will configure text:

```md
/g_south,y_20,co_white,l_text:Tahu!.ttf_70:Have%20you%20been%20to%20Machu%20Picchu%3F
```

This sets a few things for our text:

- **`g_south`** — put the text at the bottom-center of the image
- **`y_20`** — move the text 20px away from the bottom of the image
- **`co_white`** — set the text color to white
- **`l_text:Tahu!.ttf_70`** — `l_text` is the overlay config, then we use the custom font's public ID, then `_70` to set the font size
- **`:Have%20you%20been%20to%20Machu%20Picchu%3F`** — we can set any text we want here — the text needs to be URI-encoded

<Aside>

**Heads up!** If you want more details on what’s going on here, I wrote a full post on [how text overlays work in Cloudinary](/blog/add-text-overlay-cloudinary/).

</Aside>

Once we've added this to the URL, it looks like this:

```md
https://res.cloudinary.com/jlengstorf/image/upload/w_800,q_auto,f_auto/g_south,y_20,co_white,l_text:Tahu!.ttf_70:Have%20you%20been%20to%20Machu%20Picchu%3F/v1578269094/llama-kimmy-williams.jpg
```

And the image now includes our text overlay using the custom font!
