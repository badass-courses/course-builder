import Figure from '../../components/figure.astro';
import Aside from '../../components/aside.astro';

If you want to learn how to get typesafety and autocomplete into your Markdown blog, we'll go through the whole process of creating a brand new blog powered by Astro content collections in this article.

## If you prefer video, I've got you covered

If you prefer learning by watching something get built, I recorded building the demo app in this post as a video tutorial. [Learn about Astro content collections and typesafe Markdown on YouTube.](https://youtu.be/TfD4RW2gR-s)

## Skip to the end

If you'd rather jump straight to looking at the source code, you can find it here:

- Repo: https://github.com/learnwithjason/astro-content-collections
- Demo: https://astro-content-collections.netlify.app

## Step 1: Set up a new Astro site

To get started, create a new Astro site:

```bash
npm create astro
```

This command kicks off a guided experience (complete with a cute robot mascot) that walks through setting up a new Astro site.

You will be asked to:

- Choose a name for the directory where the project will live
- Select "an empty project" so we can focus on content collections.
- Install npm dependencies.
- Initialize a new git repository
  - This is only necessary if you want to deploy this site. If you're just playing with content collections to learn, you can skip this step.

Once the site is created, move into the project directory:

```bash
cd astro-content-collections/
```

Start the project to make sure everything is running as expected:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open up `localhost:3000` in your browser and you should see this bare-bones page:

<Figure>
  ![a new Astro site that only displays an H1 that says,
  "Astro"](/images/astro-content-collections/new-astro-site-minimal.png)
</Figure>

Open the project in your code editor of choice and you're ready to code!

## Step 2: Add a layout

<Aside>

**Heads up!** If you're already familiar with Astro and just looking to learn how content collections work, you can skip this step.

</Aside>

To give your blog a cohesive feel, create a layout for the site at `src/layouts/default.astro` that will be shared across all pages:

```astro
---
const { title } = Astro.props;
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <meta name="generator" content="{Astro.generator}" />

    <title>{title}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <a href="/" rel="home">
        <span role="img" aria-label="Cheese">🧀</span>
      </a>
      <nav>
        <a href="/">Blog</a>
      </nav>
    </header>
    <main>
      <slot />
    </main>
  </body>
</html>

<style is:global>
  * {
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }

  html {
    color: #484844;
    font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto,
      Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
    font-size: 18px;
    line-height: 1.45;
  }

  body {
    margin: 0;
  }

  h1,
  h2 {
    color: #383833;
    line-height: 1.1;
  }

  img {
    max-width: 100%;
  }
</style>

<style>
  header {
    align-items: center;
    background-color: bisque;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    padding: 0.5rem 5%;
  }

  a[rel='home'] {
    font-size: 2.5rem;
    text-decoration: none;
  }

  nav a {
    color: #383833;
    text-decoration: none;
  }

  main {
    margin: 3rem auto;
    width: min(54ch, 90%);
  }
</style>
```

### Edit the home page to use the new layout

Update the home page to use the layout by editing `src/pages/index.astro`:

```astro
---
import Layout from '../layouts/default.astro';
---

<Layout>
  <h1>Please Read My Excellent Blog</h1>
  <p>
    I write the truth many are too afraid to speak. But I’m not afraid to speak.
    Speaking is just making mouth sounds, and to be honest it’s not very scary.
  </p>
</Layout>

<style>
  article {
    margin-top: 2rem;
  }

  h2 {
    font-size: 1.25rem;
  }

  h2 a {
    color: inherit;
    text-decoration: none;
  }

  h2 a:focus,
  h2 a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
</style>
```

Run `npm run dev` to see the updated site using the layout:

**Heads up!** Because this post isn't about the structure or styling of a blog, we won't cover how the HTML or CSS works in this project. If you have questions, definitely [let me know](https://jason.energy/links)!

</Aside>

## Step 3: Define a content collection schema

Create a new directory at `src/content/` — this is both where our content collections are defined and where the content of our blog posts will live.

Create a config file at `src/content/config.ts`:

```ts
import { z, defineCollection } from 'astro:content';

export const collections = {};
```

<Aside>

**Heads up!** If your editor complains about `astro:content` not existing, run `npx astro sync` to force the types to update and clear up the issue.

</Aside>

### Decide what fields you want in your blog metadata

For our blog, we want the following metadata to be supplied:

- Draft status — we don't want to show work-in-progress posts on the live site
- Publish date
- Title
- Category — each post needs to have exactly one category, and we only want to allow two categories: "food" and "wisdom"
- Tags — posts can optionally add tags for grouping posts together
- Sharing details — for social sharing cards, search results, and other external services, each post can specify custom details:
  - Image
  - Title
  - Description

In a standard Markdown blog, this is a lot of metadata and we'd almost certainly forget things, add extra stuff, or otherwise make a mess of our frontmatter. That's what Astro's content collections are here to help us solve: we can now be strict about what frontmatter is allowed and required for each post and provide helpful error messages if things aren't set up properly!

To do that, we'll use the `defineCollection` helper and [Zod](https://zod.dev/), a schema validation library that's included as `z` for convenience.

In `src/content/config.ts`, define your blog schema:

```ts
import { z, defineCollection } from 'astro:content';

export const collections = {
  blog: defineCollection({
    schema: z.object({
      draft: z.boolean().default(false),
      date: z.date().transform((str) => new Date(str)),
      title: z.string(),
      category: z.enum(['food', 'wisdom']),
      tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
      share: z
        .object({
          image: z.string().url().optional(),
          title: z.string(),
          description: z.string(),
        })
        .strict(),
    }),
  }),
};
```

Zod provides a clear API for defining how our frontmatter should look.

For the most part, Zod works by defining the property of the schema and using one of Zod's types as the value. For example, `title: z.string()` lets the schema know that a title must be set and it must be a string.

For more specialized use cases, we can add defaults and transforms, as well as marking things as optional. This is done using [schema methods](https://zod.dev/?id=schema-methods).

For example, the `draft` field can default to `false` so that the field can be omitted on publishable posts. We specify that by chaining `.default(false)` onto the property definition.

The `date` field will be used as a JavaScript `Date` object, so we can use the `.transform()` helper to convert the string representation of the date in frontmatter into a `Date` object for use in our code.

The `share` object uses `.strict()` to ensure that no additional fields are added to it.

<Aside>
  **Heads up!** There's a whole lot that can be done with Zod that we won't
  cover in this post. For full details, see the [Zod docs](https://zod.dev/).
</Aside>

## Step 4: Show a list of blog posts on the blog home page

With the definitions in place, we can start using the collection to display blog posts on our site! Update `src/pages/index.astro` to pull in our blog collection and display it on the home page:

```astro
---
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';
import Layout from '../layouts/default.astro';

const posts = await getCollection('blog', (post) => {
  return import.meta.env.MODE !== 'production' || post.data.draft === false;
});
---

<Layout>
  <h1>Please Read My Excellent Blog</h1>
  <p>
    I write the truth many are too afraid to speak. But I’m not afraid to speak.
    Speaking is just making mouth sounds, and to be honest it’s not very scary.
  </p>

  {
    posts.map((post) => {
      return (
        <article>
          <h2>
            <a href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.data.share.title}</a>
          </h2>
          <p>{post.data.share.description}</p>
          <p>
            <a href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>full post &rarr;</a>
          </p>
        </article>
      );
    })
  }
</Layout>

<style>
  /* styles are unchanged */
</style>
```

The `getCollection` helper allows us to pull in everything in the `blog` collection, which we then filter to show posts where `draft` is `true` in development mode, but not in production.

In the page body, we map over the loaded posts and add markup to display a preview of each post.

If we save this, nothing changes in the browser. This is a good thing: we haven't added any blog posts yet! Empty collections don't throw errors. We _could_ add logic to check for an empty `posts` array and show an empty state, but in our case we're going to publish a couple blogs right away, so we won't need it.

## Step 5: Create your first blog posts

Create your first blog post by adding the following to a new file at `src/content/blog/cheese.md`:

```md
---
draft: true

date: 2023-01-14
title: Eat Cheese Every Day

category: food
tags:
  - gouda
  - cheddar
  - brie

share:

```

The home page will now show the blog preview:

</Figure>

Create a second post by adding the following to a new file at `src/content/blog/good-advice.md`:

```md
---
draft: false

date: 2023-01-17
title: The Yellow Ones Don’t Stop

They’re everywhere. They’re looking for you. And they’re _very_ angry.
```

After saving, the homepage is now showing an error!

<Figure>
  ![an Astro error informing the developer that the frontmatter for the new post
  failed
  validation](/images/astro-content-collections/astro-content-collection-validation-error.png)
</Figure>

The error message says:

```
blog → good-advice.md frontmatter does not match collection schema.
"category" is required.
```

What a great error message! We forgot to add a `category` field to the frontmatter, and since that one is required the schema validation fails.

This is ideal, because without the typesafety we might not notice this until our build failed, or — worse — until a user let us know that our site is broken.

Edit `src/content/blog/good-advice.md` to include `category: wisdom` in the frontmatter, then save and check out the home page again. Everything works as expected!

<Figure>
  ![the home page showing two blog
  previews](/images/astro-content-collections/astro-content-collection-multiple-posts.png)
</Figure>

Right now, though, if we click to read one of these posts we'll get a 404. In the next section we'll create individual blog pages from the collection.

## Step 6: Create individual blog pages from an Astro content collection

Since we don't want to create an individual page every time we write a blog post, we'll use a [dynamic route](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/routing/?utm_source=jason-lengstorf&utm_medium=link&utm_term=2.0+launch&utm_campaign=blog#dynamic-routes) for our blog posts.

Create a new file at `src/pages/blog/[slug].astro` and add the following:

```astro
---
import { CollectionEntry, getCollection } from 'astro:content';
import Layout from '../../layouts/default.astro';

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await getCollection('blog');

  return posts.map((post) => {
    return {
      params: {
        slug: post.slug,
      },
      props: {
        post,
      },
    };
  });
}

interface Props {
  post: CollectionEntry<'blog'>;
}

const { post } = Astro.props;
const { Content } = await post.render();
---

<Layout>
  <header>
    <h1>{post.data.title}</h1>
    <p>{post.data.share.description}</p>
  </header>

  <Content />

  <footer>
    <ul class="tags">
      {post.data.tags?.map((tag) => <li>{tag}</li>)}
    </ul>
    <p>
      <a href="/">&larr; back to all posts</a>
    </p>
  </footer>
</Layout>

<style>
  header {
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
  }

  header p {
    font-size: 1.125rem;
  }

  footer {
    border-top: 1px solid #d8d8d3;
    margin-top: 2rem;
  }

  .tags {
    color: #787873;
    display: flex;
    gap: 1rem;
    list-style: none;
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
    padding: 0;
  }

  .tags li::before {
    content: '#';
  }
</style>
```

Using `getCollection` again, we load all the blog posts, then use `getStaticPaths` let Astro know the slug and post data for each of our blog posts.

Then, we grab the `post` out of the props and define our markup in the Astro page body.

To get autocomplete, we define an interface for `Props` that uses the `CollectionEntry<'blog'>` type for our post. This is _incredibly_ handy because it means we can press `control` + `space` to pull up a list of all the available properties on our `post` object.

Loading the Markdown content of the post is done by calling `await post.render()`, which returns an object including a `Content` component that we can place wherever we want the post body to be displayed.

Save this, click on one of the blog posts, and you've got a fully functional, fully typesafe Markdown blog running using Astro content collections!
