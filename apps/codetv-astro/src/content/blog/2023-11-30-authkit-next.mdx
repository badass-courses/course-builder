There are lots of options to get auth set up quickly, but they often aren't built to handle the more complex, enterprise features that you hope to grow into over time. In the other direction, user management that's powerful enough for a more mature company is usually so cumbersome and expensive to set up that it's borderline foolish to start with it.

[AuthKit](https://www.authkit.com/) caught my attention because its stated intention is to fit the needs of early-stage companies as well as more mature, complex use cases. They have a hosted UI for getting full-featured user management set up in a few lines of code, plus they have a full SDK for building custom user management flows and adding enterprise features like SSO. I love this, because it lines up with my views on [progressive disclosure of complexity](https://jason.energy/progressive-disclosure-of-complexity/) in software.

In this tutorial, you'll use AuthKit to **add user management to a Next.js project using the app directory, React server components, and server actions**.

  When the [WorkOS](https://lwj.dev/workos) team hit me up to give AuthKit a try, I was excited to dive in. Huge thanks to them for sponsoring this tutorial.

## Enable authentication in your WorkOS dashboard

To enable authentication, head to dashboard.workos.com, then click the Authentication tab and make sure that at least one of the methods is enabled.

<Figure caption="Make sure at least one of Email + Password, Google OAuth, or Microsoft OAuth are enabled.">
  ![the authentication tab of the WorkOS daashboard with Google and Microsoft OAuth enabled](https://res.cloudinary.com/jlengstorf/image/upload/w_1800,q_auto,f_auto,b_rgb:a8fffb/lwj/blog/authkit-00-workos-dashboard.jpg)
</Figure>

While you're in here, also make sure to visit the Redirects tab and make sure `http://localhost:3000/callback` is added as a sign-in callback.

## Get the project cloned and running

We'll be starting from a modified version of the official AuthKit example app, which is built using the app directory in Next.js and [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/) (the same UI library AuthKit uses to create the hosted UI). We're not going to focus on the UI — instead, we'll only be looking at the specific code that makes user login and session management work in the app.

To get started, clone the app:

```bash
# clone the repo using the start branch
gh repo clone jlengstorf/next-authkit-example -- -b start

# move into the directory
cd workos-authkit/

# install dependencies
npm i
```

Next, copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and add the required environment variables:

```sh title=".env.local"
# Available in your WorkOS dashboard
WORKOS_CLIENT_ID="..."
WORKOS_API_KEY="..."
WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3000/callback"

# Your JWT secret key
JWT_SECRET_KEY="..."
```

To get these values:

- Head to [dashboard.workos.com](https://dashboard.workos.com/) and head to the API Keys tab
- Copy the Client ID from the top as `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID`
- Click "+ Create Key" to generate a new API key to use as `WORKOS_API_KEY`
- Leave the `WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI` set to `http://localhost:3000/callback` — this must match one of the callbacks in your [WorkOS dashboard](https://dashboard.workos.com/) Redirects tab
- Set `JWT_SECRET_KEY` to any value — I used https://www.uuidgenerator.net/

Finally, start up local development to see the app.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` to see the running site.

</Figure>

## Get the URL for signing in or signing up via AuthKit

Our first step is to get the URL that sends a user to AuthKit's hosted sign in/sign up flow. To do that, make the following changes in `src/auth.ts`:

```ts title="src/auth.ts" del={6,20} ins={7,8,21-36}
import { cookies } from "next/headers";
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";
import WorkOS, { User } from "@workos-inc/node";
import { jwtVerify } from "jose";

// TODO Initialize the WorkOS client
// Initialize the WorkOS client
export const workos = new WorkOS(process.env.WORKOS_API_KEY);

export function getClientId() {
  const clientId = process.env.WORKOS_CLIENT_ID;

  if (!clientId) {
    throw new Error("WORKOS_CLIENT_ID is not set");
  }

  return clientId;
}

// TODO get the authorization URL for logging in and signing up with AuthKit
export async function getAuthorizationUrl() {
  const redirectUri = process.env.WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI;

  if (!redirectUri) {
    throw new Error("WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI is not set");
  }

  const authorizationUrl = workos.userManagement.getAuthorizationUrl({
    provider: "authkit",
    clientId: getClientId(),
    // The endpoint that WorkOS will redirect to after a user authenticates
    redirectUri,
  });

  return authorizationUrl;
}

export function getJwtSecretKey() {
  const secret = process.env.JWT_SECRET_KEY;

  if (!secret) {
    throw new Error("JWT_SECRET_KEY is not set");
  }

  return new Uint8Array(Buffer.from(secret, "base64"));
}

// TODO verify that the JWT is valid

// TODO determine whether a user is authenticated and return user details if so

// TODO log the user out by deleting their token

```

After initializing a new instance of the WorkOS Node SDK, this file also exports a new function called `getAuthorizationUrl()`.

This function uses the [user management API](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management) — WorkOS's collection of features that make up AuthKit's core functionality. The `getAuthorizationUrl()` method takes in the client ID and redirect URI (which were set via `.env.local` earlier) and the `provider`, which is set to `'authkit'` to use the hosted UI.

Put this authorization URL to work by making the following changes in `src/app/components/sign-in-button.tsx`:

```ts title="src/app/components/sign-in-button.tsx" ins={3,11} del={8-10}
import { Button, Flex } from "@radix-ui/themes";
import { getAuthorizationUrl } from '../../auth';

export async function SignInButton({ large }: { large?: boolean }) {
  // TODO determine login status from AuthKit
  const isAuthenticated = false;

  // TODO get AuthKit authorization URL
  const authorizationUrl = "#login";
  const authorizationUrl = await getAuthorizationUrl();

  if (isAuthenticated) {
    return (
      <Flex gap="3">
        <form
          action={async () => {
            "use server";
            // TODO log the user out
          }}
        >
          <Button type="submit" size={large ? "3" : "2"}>
            Sign Out
          </Button>
        </form>
      </Flex>
    );
  }

  return (
    <Button asChild size={large ? "3" : "2"}>
      <a href={authorizationUrl}>Sign In {large && "with AuthKit"}</a>
    </Button>
  );
}
```

Save these changes, then click the "Sign In with AuthKit" button on the home page. You'll be redirected to the hosted sign in/sign up flow

<Figure caption="The user has authorized the app, but we still need to handle successful auth on our end">
  ![JSON error output that reads, "TODO: implement AuthKit callback flow"](https://res.cloudinary.com/jlengstorf/image/upload/w_1800,q_auto,f_auto,b_rgb:a8fffb/lwj/blog/authkit-02-auth-url-set.jpg)
</Figure>

The user is authorizing the app, but there's no handler in place to turn the authorization code into a user token. In the next step, we'll implement the callback handler to exchange the code for a user token.

## Create a callback handler for user logins

Exchange the code for user details by replacing the contents of `src/app/callback/route.tsx` with the following code:

```ts title="src/app/callback/route.tsx"
import { SignJWT } from "jose";
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { getJwtSecretKey, workos, getClientId } from "../../auth";

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const code = request.nextUrl.searchParams.get("code");

  if (code) {
    try {
      // Use the code returned to us by AuthKit and authenticate the user with WorkOS
      const { user } = await workos.userManagement.authenticateWithCode({
        clientId: getClientId(),
        code,
      });

      // Create a JWT token with the user's information
      const token = await new SignJWT({
        // Here you might lookup and retrieve user details from your database
        user,
      })
        .setProtectedHeader({ alg: "HS256", typ: "JWT" })
        .setIssuedAt()
        .setExpirationTime("1h")
        .sign(getJwtSecretKey());

      const url = request.nextUrl.clone();

      // Cleanup params
      url.searchParams.delete("code");

      // Redirect to the requested path and store the session
      url.pathname = "/";
      const response = NextResponse.redirect(url);

      response.cookies.set({
        name: "token",
        value: token,
        path: "/",
        httpOnly: true,
      });

      return response;
    } catch (error) {
      return NextResponse.json(error);
    }
  }

  return NextResponse.json({
    error: "No authorization code was received from AuthKit",
  });
}
```

To exchange the authorization code for user information, this code uses the `authenticateWithCode()` method.

Next, the user details are encoded into a JSON web token (JWT) using the `jose` package.

Once a token is created, the current URL is cloned, updated to point to the home page, and the code is deleted. This updated URL is where the user will be redirected after a successful authorization.

Finally, the token is added as an HTTP-only cookie before returning the response.

After saving, click the "Sign In with AuthKit" button again. You'll end up back on the home page, which still needs changes to show a logged in user, but if you check the "application" tab in your devtools and look at cookies, you'll see the `token` cookie is now present.

<Figure caption="">
  ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/jlengstorf/image/upload/w_1800,q_auto,f_auto,b_rgb:a8fffb/lwj/blog/authkit-03-cookie-set.jpg)
</Figure>

With the user token set, the next step is to read it and update the UI based on whether a user is logged in.

## Add logic to verify and load a logged in user + log out

Now that a token is set when a user is logged in, add the logic to check and verify that token by making the following changes in `src/auth.ts`:

```ts title="src/auth.ts" ins={16-23,26-41,44-47} del={15,25,43}
import { cookies } from "next/headers";
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";
import WorkOS, { User } from "@workos-inc/node";
import { jwtVerify } from "jose";

// Initialize the WorkOS client
export const workos = new WorkOS(process.env.WORKOS_API_KEY);

export function getClientId() { /* unchanged */ }

export async function getAuthorizationUrl() { /* unchanged */ }

export function getJwtSecretKey() { /* unchanged */ }

// TODO verify that the JWT is valid
export async function verifyJwtToken(token: string) {
  try {
    const { payload } = await jwtVerify(token, getJwtSecretKey());
    return payload;
  } catch (error) {
    return null;
  }
}

// TODO determine whether a user is authenticated and return user details if so
export async function getUser(): Promise<{
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  user?: User | null;
}> {
  const token = cookies().get("token")?.value;
  const verifiedToken = token && (await verifyJwtToken(token));

  if (verifiedToken) {
    return {
      isAuthenticated: true,
      user: verifiedToken.user as User | null,
    };
  }

  return { isAuthenticated: false };
}

// TODO log the user out by deleting their token
export async function clearCookie() {
  cookies().delete("token");
  redirect("/");
}
```

The `verifyJwtToken()` function uses the `jose` package to make sure the token was created using the secret key set in `.env.local`.

The `getUser()` function loads the `token` cookie, verifies it using `verifyJwtToken()`, then returns an object with the current authentication status (`isAuthenticated`) and, when a user is logged in, the user's details such as name and email.

The `clearCookie()` function deletes the cookie and redirects the user to the home page — this will be used to handle the logout action.

## Only show the account details page to logged in users

For protected routes, such as the account details page, use Next.js middleware to check for a valid token and, if none is found, redirect the user to the authorization URL. Replace the contents of `src/middleware.ts` with the following code:

```ts title="src/middleware.ts"
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { getAuthorizationUrl, verifyJwtToken } from "./auth";

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const { cookies } = request;
  const { value: token } = cookies.get("token") ?? { value: null };

  const hasVerifiedToken = token && (await verifyJwtToken(token));

  // Redirect unauthenticated users to the AuthKit flow
  if (!hasVerifiedToken) {
    const authorizationUrl = await getAuthorizationUrl();
    const response = NextResponse.redirect(authorizationUrl);

    response.cookies.delete("token");

    return response;
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}

// Match against the account page
export const config = { matcher: ["/account/:path*"] };
```

After saving, delete the `token` cookie in the Application tab of your devtools and try to visit the account tab — you'll be redirected to the AuthKit authorization flow.

## Update the UI to use authentication information

The last step is to make the UI react to the presence of a logged in user.

### Add user details to the account page

First, make the following changes to `src/app/account/page.tsx`:

```ts title="src/app/account/page.tsx" ins={2,6} del={5}
import { Text, Heading, TextFieldInput, Flex, Box } from "@radix-ui/themes";
import { getUser } from "../../auth";

export default async function AccountPage() {
  const user: any = {};
  const { user } = await getUser();

  const userFields = user && [
    ["First name", user.firstName],
    ["Last name", user.lastName],
    ["Email", user.email],
    ["Id", user.id],
  ];

  return (
    <>
      <Flex direction="column" gap="2" mb="7">
        <Heading size="8" align="center">
          Account details
        </Heading>
        <Text size="5" align="center" color="gray">
          Below are your account details
        </Text>
      </Flex>

      {userFields && (
        <Flex
          direction="column"
          gap="3"
          style={{ width: 400 }}
          justify="center"
        >
          {userFields.map(([label, value]) => (
            <Flex asChild align="center" gap="6" key={value}>
              <label>
                <Text weight="bold" size="3" style={{ width: 100 }}>
                  {label}
                </Text>

                <Box grow="1">
                  <TextFieldInput value={value || ""} readOnly />
                </Box>
              </label>
            </Flex>
          ))}
        </Flex>
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

The account page is only available to logged in accounts, so all it needs is the `user` details returned by `getUser()`.

### Turn the "sign in" button to a "sign out" button when logged in

Next, make the following changes to `src/app/components/sign-in-button.tsx`:

```ts title="src/app/components/sign-in-button.tsx" del={1,6-7,17} ins={2,8,18}
import { getAuthorizationUrl } from "../../auth";
import { clearCookie, getAuthorizationUrl, getUser } from "../../auth";
import { Button, Flex } from "@radix-ui/themes";

export async function SignInButton({ large }: { large?: boolean }) {
  // TODO determine login status from AuthKit
  const isAuthenticated = false;
  const { isAuthenticated } = await getUser();
  const authorizationUrl = await getAuthorizationUrl();

  if (isAuthenticated) {
    return (
      <Flex gap="3">
        <form
          action={async () => {
            "use server";
            // TODO log the user out
            await clearCookie();
          }}
        >
          <Button type="submit" size={large ? "3" : "2"}>
            Sign Out
          </Button>
        </form>
      </Flex>
    );
  }

  return (
    <Button asChild size={large ? "3" : "2"}>
      <a href={authorizationUrl}>Sign In {large && "with AuthKit"}</a>
    </Button>
  );
}
```

This change uses the actual authenticated status to show a "sign out" button when a user is logged in. It also uses a server action to delete the token cookie when clicked, allowing the user to log out and be redirected to the home page.

### Update the home page for logged in users

Finally, make the following changes to `src/app/page.tsx`:

```ts title="src/app/page.tsx" ins={4,12} del={7-11}
import { Button, Flex, Heading, Text } from "@radix-ui/themes";
import NextLink from "next/link";
import { SignInButton } from "./components/sign-in-button";
import { getUser } from "../auth";

export default async function HomePage() {
  // TODO determine login status from AuthKit
  const isAuthenticated = false;

  // TODO load user details from AuthKit when logged in
  const user: any = {};
  const { isAuthenticated, user } = await getUser();

  return (
    <Flex direction="column" align="center" gap="2">
      {isAuthenticated ? (
        <>
          <Heading size="8">
            Welcome back{user?.firstName && `, ${user?.firstName}`}
          </Heading>
          <Text size="5" color="gray">
            You are now authenticated into the application
          </Text>
          <Flex align="center" gap="3" mt="4">
            <Button asChild size="3" variant="soft">
              <NextLink href="/account">View account</NextLink>
            </Button>
            <SignInButton large />
          </Flex>
        </>
      ) : (
        <>
          <Heading size="8">AuthKit authentication example</Heading>
          <Text size="5" color="gray" mb="4">
            Sign in to view your account details
          </Text>
          <SignInButton large />
        </>
      )}
    </Flex>
  );
}
```

This swaps out the hard-coded values for real login status and user details. Save to see the user details displayed on the home page when a user is logged in.

## Going further with user management

As your app grows, you may want to add new features or customize how things look. This is where AuthKit is uniquely valuable, as far as I can tell.

### Bring your own UI

If you want to customize the UI instead of using a hosted workflow, the user management APIs are available in the WorkOS Node SDK to do anything AuthKit can do within your own UI.

I won't go into how, but they have a ton of [examples up on GitHub](https://github.com/workos/authkit/tree/main/src/app/using-your-own-ui) to get you started.

### Add enterprise features

You might have spotted it when you enabled authentication in your WorkOS dashboard, but adding enterprise user management features like single sign-on is a checkbox away. For more details, check out my tutorial on [SSO with WorkOS in a Node app](https://www.codetv.dev/blog/workos-sso-okta-idp).
