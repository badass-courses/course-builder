	This episode is part of the [_Web Dev Challenge_ series](https://lwj.dev/wdc), which was previously referred to as _4 Web Devs, 1 App Idea_.

## The Challenge

> Build an AI-powered app that's not another f%\*#in' chatbot.

So much of what we see in the AI space are variations on the chatbot interface. Carter at DataStax challenged the devs to build something different.

## The Tool

All apps must use [Astra DB](https://lwj.dev/astra-db) as part of the final build. Astra DB provides a vector store and tools for generating vector embeddings from any data you choose.

## The Rules

In the _Web Dev Challenge_, the rules are:

- 4 web developers each build a web app
- The web app is built to complete a specific challenge
- The web app must include a given tool or technology, which changes each episode
- Devs are given 30 minutes to plan
- Devs are given 4 hours to build
- At the end of 4 hours, the devs demo the web app they've built

_Web Dev Challenge_ is not a competition. Instead, it's a chance to build something with low stakes, learn something new, and have fun with friends.
