	## What discounts are available?

	There are no hidden special discounts available.

	We support purchase power parity. This is automated based on IP address of the computer you are using to make the purchase. It's an imperfect system and the discount does not always display.

	Note that if you use the PPP discount your purchase will be restricted to the country you purchased it from.

</div>
<div>

	## How do the “team” seats work? What is a “seat” in this context?

	When you buy a team seat, you receive a link that can be used to register for the number of accounts you have purchased. The license is non-transferable (you cannot reassign a license from one person to another).

</div>
<div>

	## If I buy a volume, will future courses be included in my purchase?

	No. You will have to purchase each course separately. This is a one-off purchase, not a membership or subscription.

</div>
<div>

	## When will future courses be released?

	Any future course will be released when it is finished.

</div>
<div>

	## What content will be in future courses?

	We will announce the content of future courses when they exist.

</div>
<div>

	## Will this be updated for future Next.js releases?

	Maybe, but base your purchase on what you see today. There is no guarantee of future updates or promise of additional content. Purchasing this volume does not entitle access to future volumes.

</div>
<div>

	## What is PPP?

	Purchasing Power Parity - a lower price for users in certain countries; content is a bit cheaper and the course is only accessible from the country it is purchased from.

</div>
<div>

	## Can I gift a license to someone else?

	Yes, you can! Simply enter their email address instead of your own. There might be a verification code they receive that you’ll have to request from them. Also, if you buy a PPP license, then make sure you’re both in the same country otherwise they won’t be able to access the content in their country.

	You can also purchase a a team license and then distribute the link to your team members and anybody else.

</div>
<div>

	## Is it possible to buy the course some other way? Installments? PayPal/etc?

	No, the only available buying options are those on the site right now.

</div>
<div>

	## Does PPP limit bonus content?

	PPP purchases are limited to the content that is displayed at the time of purchase and current and future bonus materials and features might not be available.

	If there are no bonuses _right now_ on ProNextJS's course - we may introduce some further down the line.

	When in doubt, and if you want to guarantee access to everything, purchase the product without PPP discount.

</div>
<div>

	## Does my company own the team license(s)?

	Team licenses are actually coupon codes that can be redeemed by users. Companies are not meant to own or keep the licenses.

	They are meant to be distributed and are owned by the individual that claims that seat.

	They cannot be transferred or "passed around".

</div>
<div>

	## Can I customize the invoice? VAT/company details?

	Yes, there’s a textarea that allows you to put any arbitrary information into the invoice PDF/printable.

</div>
<div>

	## Who is ProNextJS for?

	ProNextJS is great both for beginners, and for those already familiar with Next.js. Our [Next.js Foundations for Professional Web Development](/workshops/next-js-foundations-for-professional-web-development~lxb18) course covers material from beginner to intermediate, and the [other workshops](/workshops) cover more advanced content.

	We recommend some beginner JavaScript & React experience before diving in.

</div>
<div>

	## What if I've been working with and studying Next.js for years?

	You'll still learn something! ProNextJS's workshops dig deep and provide interactive exercises to help you master Next.js.

</div>
<div>

	## Is there any live aspect to ProNextJS or is it all self-paced?

	It is all self-paced but [the Discord Community](/discord) is very active.

</div>
<div>

	## What versions of Next.js is this compatible with?

	The course is up to date and compatible with Next.js v14.2.x

</div>
<div>

	## I'm having trouble getting the repo running locally. Are there any alternatives?

	Yes! All of the repos work in Gitpod.

</div>
<div>

	## Can I change my email address with which I bought the course?

	Yes. Contact the support team at [team@pronextjs.dev](mailto:team@pronextjs.dev?subject=ProNextJS:%20Email%20Change%20Request).

	You cannot transfer your license to another person.
