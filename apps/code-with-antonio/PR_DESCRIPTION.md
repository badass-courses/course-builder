# Workshop Structure for AI Hero

This PR implements the workshop structure feature for AI Hero, providing a foundation for creating and managing interactive workshops.

## Changes Made

### Major Architectural Improvements
- 🏗️ Implemented Higher-Order Component (HOC) pattern for resource forms
- 🔧 Refactored workshop and lesson forms to use the withResourceForm HOC
- 🧩 Created separate base components and config files for better separation of concerns
- 💪 Improved type safety across the entire feature by using proper type guards

### Decoupling & Abstraction
- 🔄 Removed specific PostType dependencies and made components more generic
- 🌉 Changed PostType references to string types for better abstraction
- 🎯 Improved reusability by removing direct coupling between components

### Addressed PR Feedback
- ✅ Added null checks to workshop resource tools to prevent runtime errors
- ✅ Improved URL extraction regex for drag-and-drop functionality
- ✅ Added error handling for resource parsing in EditWorkshopForm
- ✅ Added pagination limit (50) to workshop queries to prevent performance issues with large datasets
- ✅ Simplified conditional logic in lessons-query
- ✅ Fixed type issues in form configs
- ✅ Removed unused imports

### Original PR Features
- Workshop creation and editing interface
- Support for workshop resources and lessons
- Media management for workshops
- Proper type safety and validation

## Technical Details
- New pattern uses `withResourceForm` HOC to inject common functionality
- Resource forms now follow a consistent pattern with separate config objects
- Form base components handle UI elements while HOCs handle data flow
- Added robust error handling for resource type checking and parsing

## Testing
All changes have been verified to work properly and the TypeScript compiler passes without errors.
