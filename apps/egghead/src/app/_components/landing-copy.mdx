# egghead Post Builder

This site is for registered egghead instructors (please log in) that want to
self-publish to egghead. Right now it's focused on `Posts` which are similar to
what we've traditionally referred to as an `egghead Lesson`, that is stand
alone, and not specifically part of a collection like a Course or a Playlist.

A Post can have many underlying types, eventually including collections such as
playlists and courses, but for now we are going to stick to one offs. We are
already publishing podcast episodes as videos to the site, so if you're
interested in that type of content, please reach out to us.

As you create related posts, we will open up the discussion with you about how
you'd like to present it in a collection to your audience.

**This site is live and when you hit `publish` the content will be available on
egghead.io!**

## What to publish

We are looking for content that is useful to egghead members and the broader
community of developers. egghead has traditionally been focused on web
developers with a leaning towards front-end, but anything useful to developers
is probably interesting.

egghead members are forward-thinking, busy, working professionals so the point
of egghead in terms of paying for a subscription is to stay current and make
sure that there is an understanding of what's on the horizon in terms of
technology and how they will be building software later this year and next.

- How is AI affecting there work as developers?
- What are the core tools and libraries that are changing the way we build
  software beyond the obvious?
- What are the latest trends in the TypeScript ecosystem?
- What are the undiscovered slept-on gems that are making you more productive as
  a developer?
- What are the latest trends in the framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular,
  Solid etc) ecosystem?
- How do the trends affect working developers, probably in larger enterprise
  size organizations?

### Posts are connected to egghead royalties

Published posts viewed on egghead will count towards revenue share royalties
based on completions.

### How are Posts announced and distributed?

We plan on sending emails to the egghead audience that aggregates posts that are
published. We will be building RSS feeds for posts as well, and allow folks to
subscribe to topics as well as individual posts for real-time notifications.
