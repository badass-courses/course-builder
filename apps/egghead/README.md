# Course Builder Video Blog

This is a video blog example built with the [Course Builder](https://github.com/badass-courses/course-builder) framework.

PRs welcome!

## Local Setup

This app can be run locally. It requires API keys for many 3rd-party services.
You can get an idea of what those are from the `.env.example` file. If you have
access to the Course Builder project in Vercel, you'll be able to _pull_ most of
these environment variables from there. Otherwise, you'll have to set up
accounts with each of the services as needed.

### Env Vars from Vercel

For those with access to the project in Vercel, here is how to grab those env
vars.

**NOTE: you'll want to make sure you've `cd`'d into
`<project-root>/apps/course-builder-video-blog` for this**:

- 1. Make sure you are signed in to the Vercel CLI
  - `vercel login`
- 2. Is the app/project cloned on your machine **linked** to the corresponding
     project on Vercel?
  - Run `vercel env pull` and if not, it will say,
    `Error: Your codebase isnâ€™t linked to a project on Vercel. Run 'vercel link' to begin.`
- 3. Link your local project to the project on Vercel
  - This step always seems like it is about to setup a fresh deployment of the
    app. Just make sure to carefully answer the prompts.
  - `vercel link`
    - "Set up `path/to/your/project`?" **Yes**
    - "Which scope should contain your project?" **Skill Recordings**
    - "Link to existing project?" **Yes** (note, default is No here)
    - "What's the name of your existing project?" **course-builder-poc** (check
      in the Vercel dashboard for the exact name of whatever project it is)
- 4. Pull the environment variables from Vercel
  - `vercel env pull`
  - At this point, the vercel CLI will have created a `.env.local` file with all
    of the `development` environment variables.
    - If for some reason you are needing environment variables for a different
      environment, you can include the `--environment` flag in the above command
      like so:
      - `vercel env pull --environment=preview`

_Note: Because of
[Next.js Enviornment Variable Load Order](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables#environment-variable-load-order),
the `.env.local` file generated in this step will override many values that you
may want to set in the `.env` or `.env.development` files. Any env vars in
development that you want to take precedence over what is in `.env.local` will
need to go in `.env.local.development`._

### Install dependences

Make sure you have [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) installed.

Then from the root project directory, install all the node dependencies:

```
$ pnpm install
```

### Set up a stable public proxy URL

[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is a tool that can proxy requests to and from a
localhost server to a URL on the public internet. You can set up a free account
and then create one-off URLs with:

```
$ ngrok http 3000
```

Note: with a free account, this URL will change each time you restart the
`ngrok` command, so make sure to update it in the relevant places when that
happens.

Grab this URL because you'll need it for a couple `.env.development.local`
values and for the _GitHub OAuth Setup_.

Set the following URLs in your `.env.development.local`:

```
# for webhooks use ngrok or similar for stable DNS accessible URL
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://some-unique-value.ngrok-free.app/api/auth"
UPLOADTHING_URL="https://some-unique-value.ngrok-free.app"
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL="https://some-unique-value.ngrok-free.app"
```

_Note: `NEXTAUTH_URL` now needs to end in `/api/auth` for NextAuth v5._

### GitHub OAuth Setup

This app uses GitHub as its OAuth provider. For local development, you'll need
to create your own GitHub OAuth Application.

You can create one by visiting the
[_Register a new OAuth Application_](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
and following these steps:

- 1. Give it an application name, e.g. "Bob's Local Course Builder"
- 2. Set the Homepage URL to the `ngrok` URL you got in the previous section
- 3. Set the Authorization callback URL to match the `NEXTAUTH_URL` set in the
     previous section
- 4. No need to give a Description or check Enable Device Flow
- 5. Click 'Register Application'

You will now be dropped on your OAuth Application page where you can:

- 1. Copy the Client ID into the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` env var
- 2. Generate a Client Secret and copy it into the `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` env
     var

These can both go in `.env.development.local`.

### Database Setup

This app uses Planetscale as the database provider and Drizzle as the ORM and
migrator.

You'll need to set the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to a (non-production)
Planetscale connection URL.

First, create a new database in Planetscale. Copy the connection string that you
get into the `.env` file as `DATABASE_URL` and make sure that it ends with an
SSL query parameter formatted as `?ssl={"rejectUnauthorized":true}`.

Then, apply the database schema to that new database with:

```
$ pnpm db:push
```

Now you can seed the new database with basic roles/permissions:

```bash
$ pnpm db:seed
```

### Start the Local Dev Server

1. `pnpm dev` to start the app on localhost in watch mode with inngest and
   partykit

### Create an Admin User

1. Visit the `ngrok` URL in your browser
2. Click 'Sign In' and authenticate with our GitHub account
3. Connect to your database through the SQL console (planetscale), Drizzle Studio
   (see below), or your favorite database client gui.

#### Configuring Drizzle Studio

1. Configure and run Drizzle Studio, which acts as a local interface for your
   remote database.
   1. If you're using Safari, you'll need to `brew install mkcert` and then
      `mkcert -install` first. (You will have to install xcode-select tooling if
      you don't have it, just follow the prompts)
   2. Run `pnpm db:studio`
   3. Navigate to `https://local.drizzle.studio` (this is broken)
2. Via Drizzle Studio (other flows are possible if you'd prefer, but this is the
   one we're documenting) find your new `user` record and change the `role` to
   `admin`. Make sure to save/apply the change.
3. When you visit `/posts`, you'll see the form for creating a new Post.
