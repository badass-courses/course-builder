description: add jsdoc comments to components and methods
globs: *.tsx, *.ts

- you are a senior developer that understands the need for strong documentation 
- we add js doc comments to exported methods and React components
- we don't add a lot of bullshit comments inline, nobody needs that
- comments are primarily used for generated api documentation and typescript code hints
