						Undervalued. Overlooked. Dispensable. Discarded.
					</h2>

					<p>
						These are just a few words that describe the pain that many
						designers are feeling right now.
					</p>

					<p>
						Tech is at an existential crossroads -{' '}
						<span className="italic">is it threatening or empowering?</span> –
						and widespread layoffs bring an added layer of uncertainty to the
						struggle against burnout.
					</p>

					<p>
						It’s easy to feel helpless. But looking at the industry from this
						perspective isn’t productive for your job in the short term, and it
						isn’t healthy for your career in the long term.
					</p>

					<p>
						Take a step back. Look at design from a different angle. There is a
						better way forward for our industry, and it starts with asking why
						people buy design in the first place.
					</p>

					<h2 className="font-heading text-center text-3xl font-semibold sm:text-4xl lg:text-5xl xl:text-6xl">
						Another World is Possible
					</h2>
					<p>
						Designers are good at researching why customers buy products, but
						the majority of us don’t perform the same research on our own jobs.
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Why do clients choose to work with us?</li>
						<li>Why do we get hired to practice design?</li>
						<li>What’s our own purpose?</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						This research is essential because it helps us understand the value
						that we bring to the table. It helps us understand how we can be
						essential to our clients and our companies.
					</p>

					<p>
						Design isn’t bought because of trends like crypto, large-language
						models, or even because our portfolios have a specific aesthetic.
					</p>

					<p>
						People buy design because{' '}
						<span className="font-bold">
							there’s an expensive problem that needs to be solved
						</span>{' '}
						in a way that the designer’s specific expertise is uniquely suited
						to solve.
					</p>

					<p>
						Businesses want to increase profit, lower their costs, and reduce
						risk.
					</p>

					<p>
						They will invest in anything that can affect one of those variables.
						When you are a person who can help them do that, you become valuable
						to the business.
					</p>

					<h2 className="font-heading text-center text-3xl font-semibold sm:text-4xl lg:text-5xl xl:text-6xl">
						Become Essential
					</h2>

					<p>
						By connecting your design decisions to these business objectives,
						you've made it easy for others to see the impact of your work. You
						can't be overlooked when the design you produced increases profit at
						a lower cost to the business.
					</p>

					<p className="font-bold">This makes you essential.</p>

					<p>
						When you’re essential, you'll survive that next round of layoffs.
						You'll get promoted into a role with more power. You'll find a job
						that respects you. In short, you will finally pull up that
						ever-elusive seat at the table that we all keep hearing about.
					</p>

					<p>
						By rooting your design practice in the generation of value, which we
						call value-based design, you'll move the business in the right
						direction and be recognized for your efforts.
					</p>

					<h2 className="font-heading text-center text-3xl font-semibold sm:text-4xl lg:text-5xl xl:text-6xl">
						Design with Value in Mind
					</h2>

					<p>
						Design runs much deeper than selecting the right typography, color,
						and composition of elements on a page. It speaks to the value that
						people get from the service your business offers.
					</p>

					<p>
						Your design should increase that value through an iterative,
						holistic approach.
					</p>

					<p>
						Value-based design will level up your approach by incorporating
						elements of customer success, product, interaction design, and user
						research that are grounded in evidence.
					</p>

					<p>
						You'll be provided with a framework to research, measure, and
						experiment with solutions to the problems that your business has
						today.
					</p>

					<p>When you become a practitioner of value-based design, you’ll:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							Use your design sense to reliably deliver work that has an impact
						</li>
						<li>Understand how to ground design decisions in evidence</li>
						<li>
							Apply the soft skills you need to survive and thrive in any
							organization
						</li>
						<li>Accurately measure the impact of your decisions</li>
						<li>
							Advocate for design in a way that’s fundamentally impossible to
							ignore
						</li>
					</ul>
