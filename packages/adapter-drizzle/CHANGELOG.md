  [`2def195558d69b00ce6c1001781215c97488a99b`](https://github.com/badass-courses/course-builder/commit/2def195558d69b00ce6c1001781215c97488a99b)
  Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - adding adapter and core
  packages to extend the pattern that is presented by authjs to include Course
  Builder `contentResource` schema

  this approach will allow us to maintain adapters for mysql, sqlite, and pg,
  potentially beyond drizzle if needed
