# Course Builder

Course Builder is a real-time multiplayer CMS for building and deploying the opinionated data structures of developer education products

The main Course Builder web application can be found in `apps/course-builder-web` and has further instructions in the readme.

This is a monorepo managed by [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/)

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
cd apps/course-builder-web
cp .env.example .env
pnpm dev
```

All of the environment variables for various services are the biggest obstacle to getting started. You can find the environment variables in the `apps/course-builder-web/.env` file. You can copy the `apps/course-builder-web/.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the values for the environment variables. If you're a Skill Recordings team member, you can pull the `env` from Vercel. See the app project readme for more information.

`pnpm dev` from the root of the project will run all the packages in the monorepo in development watch mode. Very convenient.

It does not run the `apps`. Those need to be individually started.
