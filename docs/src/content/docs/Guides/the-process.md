Heres's a behind-the-scenes look at how we create courses at [Badass Courses](https://badass.dev). You see, it's not
just about having a great idea or being an expert on a topic. It's about a repeatable process we've honed over time. We call it, quite simply,

"The Process" (creative, I know!).

So, what's this all about? It's our four-step playbook that keeps our team
synced up and our courses top-notch. From researching what our learners actually
want to learn, to designing and building the course, all the way to getting it
out there â€“ we've got it down to an art (and a bit of science).

Let's break it down:

## Step 1: Research

This is where we put on our detective hats. We dig into what's hot in the
market, chat with experts, and basically do our homework. It's all about getting
those 'aha!' moments to guide our courses.

## Step 2: Design

Not just making things look pretty (although we love that part), but mapping out
how our learners will actually learn. We're talking instructional design,
learner experience â€“ AND the visual design.

## Step 3: Production

Here's where we roll up our sleeves and bring the course to life. Think of it as
our digital construction zone, where all the planning starts to take shape.

## Step 4: Delivery

Build it and they will come? Nope, not really. This is where we shout from the
rooftops about our shiny new course. Marketing, launching, and getting it into
the hands of eager learners.

And the best part? We go through this cycle over and over, each time getting
sharper, more in tune with our learners, and honestly, having a blast doing it.

That's The Process ðŸŒ€! It's how we keep pushing the boundaries of online
learning and making sure our courses are not just courses, but experiences that
stick with you.
