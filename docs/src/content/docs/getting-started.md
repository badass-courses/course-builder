Course Builder is a Turborepo project that includes the website, this docs site you are reading right now, and the
various libraries and packages that represent the Course Builder platform.

:::note 
This guide is a work in progress. It will be updated as the project evolves. 
:::

It's non-trivial and these guides are going to make several assumptions:

- You are familiar with [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- You are familiar with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- You are familiar with [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- You are familiar with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- You are familiar with [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/)
- You are familiar with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- You are deploying to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

This is a **lot** of assumptions!

There will be plenty of detail and links, but if you are not familiar with these technologies, you may want to start
with some of the links above.

## Next.js and the T3 Stack

The Course Builder website is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It uses
[`create-t3-app`](https://create.t3.gg/) to scaffold the project. This provides a consistent opinionated starting point
for Next.js projects.

- NextAuth
- TailwindCSS
- tRPC
- Drizzle ORM
- CASL

Course Builder is using the Next.js App Router which makes use of React Server Components.

For the sake of simplicity, Course Builder is deployed to Vercel. This might not be a strict requirement, but hosting on
other platforms is left as an exercise for the reader.

## Integrated Third-Party Services

Course Builder is integrated with several third-party services. These are all currently required for the project to
function. This means that you will need to create accounts with these services and configure them for your project by
adding the various keys and secrets to your environment variables in the `course-builder-web` app.

- [Sanity](https://sanity.io): Content management
- [Inngest](https://inngest.com): event-driven workflows
- [Partykit](https://www.partykit.io/): Real-time updates across the system
- [Mux](https://www.mux.com/): Video delivery
- [GitHub](https://github.com/): Authentication
- [uploadthing](https://uploadthing.com): Uploading videos
- [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com): Sending emails
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/): AI-powered content generation

It's possible to swap these out to suit your needs and preferences, but the assumption in these guides is that you will
be using these services.

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/badass-courses/course-builder
```

## Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Configure Environment Variables

```bash
cd /apps/course-builder-web
cp .env.example .env
```

They are all required.

:::note 
There are 3 (THREE!) different entries for the URL of the project in the environment 
:::

```dotenv
NEXTAUTH_URL="YOUR_TUNNEL.ngrok-free.app/api/auth"
UPLOADTHING_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL="https://YOUR_TUNNEL.ngrok-free.app/"
```

This is because the project is using several different services that need to know the URL of the project. This is a bit
of a pain, but it's the way it is for now. :::
